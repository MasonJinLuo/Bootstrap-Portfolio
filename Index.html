                <p>My name is Mason Luo. I am an American born Chinese, born and raised in Chicago. I have 2 siblings, and older sister and a twin sister. I graduated from Chamberlain College of Nursing in August 2015 with a Bachlor in Science of Nursing. I have been a nurse for a little over a year. During my time as nurse, I have discover my love and interest in working with computers. In which a friend of mine introduced me to Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. Not too long after, I was accepted into Northwestern University School of Professional Studies. </p>

                <p> My first goal in this program is not only to finish the course, but to understand and use the material I have learned in a real world setting. After I completed the course, I would be able to achieve a complete career change. My fears currently are that I won't be able to understand everything that is being taught to me as well as forgetting what is taught to me. However Northwestern has many wonderful resources and staff that will help me achieve my goals. </p>
